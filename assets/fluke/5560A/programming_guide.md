# Fluke 5560A/5550A/5540A/5530A Remote Programming Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This Markdown file is optimized as a compact, retrieval-friendly knowledge source for LLMs, GPT Codex, RAG pipelines, and code-generation agents that create software for remote control of Fluke 5560A/5550A/5540A/5530A calibrators.

The source material is the Fluke remote programmer manual. The conversion prioritizes:

- stable Markdown headings for semantic retrieval,
- one command per atomic section,
- explicit command names in backticks,
- practical programming rules for PyVISA, serial, socket/Telnet, and test automation,
- preservation of parameters, responses, examples, status-register behavior, and error codes,
- removal of OCR/page-header noise, repeated footers, warranty boilerplate, and broken code-fence artifacts.

## Agent instructions for LLM/Codex use

When using this file to answer questions or generate code:

1. Treat instrument control as safety-critical hardware control.
2. Do not invent commands, parameters, ranges, units, or responses. Use the command entry in this file. If a detail is not present, say that the knowledge base does not specify it.
3. Prefer command-query verification: after setting a state, use the corresponding query when available, for example `OUT` followed by `OUT?`, `OPER` followed by `OPER?`, or `WAVE` followed by `WAVE?`.
4. For commands that may take time, use `*WAI`, `*OPC`, or `*OPC?` according to the synchronization rules below.
5. For output generation code, include an error path that sends `STBY` where appropriate and drains errors using `ERR?` or `FAULT?`/`EXPLAIN?`.
6. Always respect the user's selected interface: GPIB/IEEE-488, USBTMC, RS-232, or Ethernet socket/Telnet.
7. Before generating executable code that can source hazardous voltages/currents, ensure the calling application has an explicit operator confirmation, interlock, or safety gate.
8. Remember that the 5540A does not support dual output, inductance, and 52120-related commands according to the source manual.

## Safety-critical facts

- The calibrator can produce voltages up to 1020 V rms.
- Programs must be tested carefully to avoid unintended hazardous outputs.
- Fluke recommends routines that catch errors; error handling can use the Service Request mechanism where supported.
- Serial remote control has no SRQ capability, although status registers still operate.
- `STBY` places the output in standby.
- `OPER` activates the output if the calibrator is in standby.
- `*RST` resets the instrument to the power-up state and is an overlapped command; use it intentionally, not as a harmless query.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import pyvisa


def check_errors(inst) -> list[str]:
    """Drain the instrument error queue using ERR?."""
    errors: list[str] = []
    while True:
        response = inst.query("ERR?").strip()
        errors.append(response)
        if response.startswith("0") or "No error" in response:
            break
    return errors


def safe_set_10v_dc(resource: str) -> None:
    rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
    inst = rm.open_resource(resource)
    inst.timeout = 30000
    inst.write("*CLS")
    try:
        print(inst.query("*IDN?"))
        inst.write("OUT 10 V")
        inst.query("*OPC?")          # wait until output has settled
        print(inst.query("OUT?"))
        # The caller/application should require explicit operator confirmation here.
        inst.write("OPER")
        inst.query("*OPC?")
        print(inst.query("OPER?"))
        print(check_errors(inst))
    except Exception:
        inst.write("STBY")
        raise
```

## Interface quick reference

| Interface | Connection concept | Important notes |
|---|---|---|
| IEEE-488/GPIB | Controller addresses the calibrator as talker/listener. | Uses IEEE-488.1/488.2 behavior. Interface messages such as REN/GTL/LLO are not sent as literal data commands. |
| USBTMC | NI-VISA USBTMC resource. | Resource format: `USB0::0x0F7E::0x800A::[serial number]::INSTR`. Use serial poll once before SRQ-producing commands to clear RQS. |
| RS-232 | Rear-panel serial port, DTE; null-modem cable. | Defaults: 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, 9600 baud, Ctrl-S/Ctrl-Q flow control, CR LF EOL. No SRQ line/capability. |
| Ethernet | TCP/Telnet socket. | Default socket port is `3490`. The internal LAN server accepts one client connection at a time. |

## Command synchronization rules

- Query commands end with `?` and return data.
- Compound commands are separated with semicolons, for example `OUT 1 V, 60 HZ; OPER`.
- Coupled commands in one compound command must be handled carefully because their effects can interfere.
- Overlapped commands can begin execution and complete later; use `*WAI`, `*OPC`, or `*OPC?` to synchronize.
- Do not insert `*WAI` between coupled commands that need to remain coupled.
- Use `*OPC?` when you need a blocking query that returns `1` after pending operations complete.

## Unit tokens accepted by the command parser

`HZ`, `KHZ`, `MHZ`, `UV`, `MV`, `V`, `KV`, `UA`, `MA`, `A`, `PCT`, `PPM`, `DBM`, `OHM`, `KOHM`, `MOHM`, `NF`, `PF`, `UF`, `MF`, `F`, `CEL`, `FAR`, `NS`, `US`, `MS`, `S`.

## Query and response handling rules

- A query must be followed by a read operation.
- IEEE-488 responses are terminated by ASCII LF with EOI asserted.
- RS-232/Ethernet commands must end with CR, LF, or CRLF.
- RS-232/Ethernet responses use the configured EOL setting.
- All commands and units may be entered in upper or lower case.
- Parameters are comma-separated when a command has more than one parameter.
- Expressions such as `4+2*13` are not valid command parameters.

## Remote Operations

This section describes methods to operate the Calibrator by remote control.
XW Warning
The Calibrator can produce voltages up to 1020 V rms. Program the Calibrator with
caution to prevent the production of hazardous voltages without sufficient warning to
the operator.
Write programs carefully and test them extensively to ensure safe operation of the
Calibrator. Fluke Calibration recommends that you include routines to catch errors in
your programs. These routines help to identify programming errors that can cause the
Calibrator to behave other than intended. Set the Service Request Enable (SRQ)
register to program the Calibrator to cause an SRQ when it detects an error. The
skeleton program below includes error-catching code:
10 PRINT @4, "*CLS" ! Clear status
20 PRINT @4, "*SRE 8" ! Set SRE Error Available
30 ON SRQ GOTO 1000 ! Enable SRQ Function
100 ! Place body of program here
900 STOP ! End of program
1000 REM Start of SRQ Handler ! Start routine
1010 PRINT @4, "FAULT?" ! Request fault code
1020 INPUT @4, A% ! Input fault code
1030 PRINT @4, "EXPLAIN? ";A% ! Request fault text
1040 INPUT @4, A$ ! Input fault text
1050 PRINT "Fault ";A$" detected" ! Print message
1060 PRINT @4, "STBY" ! Place 5560A in standby
1070 STOP
Operate the Product by direct local control from the front panel or by remote control from an instrument
controller, computer, or terminal. Remote control can be interactive, with each step controlled by the
user from a terminal, or can be set up to run automatically, taking commands from a computer within
an automated system. This section explains how to connect, configure, and operate the Product in
remote mode.
The remote interfaces use device-dependent commands to duplicate the functions of the front-panel
controls.The Calibrator has four remote interfaces: IEEE-488, RS-232 Serial, 10/100/1000-baseT
Ethernet, and USBTMC. All of the remote interfaces may be used simultaneously.
Note
Dual output and Inductance and 52120-related commands are not available in the 5540A.

### Set up the IEEE-488 Port for Remote Control

The Calibrator is fully programmable for use on the IEEE Standard 488.1 (GPIB) interface bus. The
IEEE-488 interface is also designed in compliance with supplemental standard IEEE-488.2, which
describes additional IEEE-488 features. Devices connected to the IEEE-488 bus are designated as
talkers, listeners, talker/listeners, or controllers. Under remote control of an instrument, the Calibrator
operates as a talker/listener.
A PC equipped with an IEEE-488 interface, controls the Calibrator. Compatible software for IEEE-488
operation may be purchased from Fluke, this includes MET/CAL.
When you use the IEEE-488 remote control interface, there are two restrictions:
• Number of Devices A maximum of 15 devices can be connected in a single IEEE-488 bus system.
For example, one instrument controller, one Calibrator, and thirteen devices under test (DUTs).
• Cable Length The total length of IEEE-488 cables used in one IEEE-488 system is 2 meters times
the number of devices in the system, or 20 meters, whichever is less. For example, if 8 devices are
connected, the maximum cable length is 2 x 8 = 16 meters. If 15 devices are connected, the
maximum cable length is 20 meters.

### IEEE-488 Interface Configuration

The Calibrator IEEE-488 interface supports the IEEE-488 interface function subsets listed in Table 1.

#### Table 1. Supported IEEE-488 Interface Function Subsets

Interface Function Description
SH1 Complete source handshake capability
AH1 Complete acceptor handshake capability
T6 Basic talker; serial poll; no talk-only function; unaddress if MLA
TE0 No extended talker capabilities
L4 Basic listener operation; no listen-only function; unaddress if MTA
LE0 No extended listener capabilities
SR1 Full service request capability with ability to bit-mask SRQ
RL1 Full remoter/local capability this includes local lockout
PP0 No parallel poll capability
DC1 Device clear capability
DT1 Device trigger capability
C0 No bus control capability

### IEEE-488 Bus Communication Overview

Communication between the controller and the Calibrator takes place with commands established by
IEEE-488.1 standards and commands specifically related to the Calibrator. The commands in Tables
20 through 28 are all the remote commands, both common and device-dependent.
Definitions of the different types of messages used on the IEEE-488 bus follow:
• Device-dependent commands are messages used to transfer information directly between the
Calibrator and the IEEE-488 controller. Some commands cause an action to take place in the
Calibrator. Others, called queries in the IEEE-488.2 standards, ask for information, and always
generate a response message from the Calibrator. While message format is governed by
IEEE-488.2 standards, message content can be unique to the Calibrator. For example, device-
dependent commands are used to set the output function and amplitude, and to switch from
standby to operate.
• Common commands defined by IEEE-488.2 standards are used for functions common to most bus
devices. Examples include the command to reset a device (*RST) and the query for device
identification (*IDN?). Common commands and queries can be identified easily because they all
begin with an asterisk (*).
• Interface messages defined by IEEE-488.1 standards have their own control lines, and others are
sent over the data lines by first asserting the control line ATN (Attention). It is important to note that
interface messages unlike device-dependent and common commands, are not sent literally (for
example, when a device-dependent query is sent to the Calibrator, the controller automatically
sends the interface message MTA (My Talk Address).

### USBTMC Interface

### Set Up the USBTMC Port for Remote Control

To use the USBTMC port for remote control, first install the necessary VISA (Virtual Instrument
Software Architecture) drivers on the host computer. Download the drivers from National Instruments
(http://www.ni.com).
NI-VISA contains a USB Test and Measurement Class (USBTMC) driver that supports the necessary
protocol to communicate with USBTMC class instruments. Once installed, the driver allows the host
computer to automatically recognize and communicate with USBTMC devices.
The USBTMC driver only recognizes USBTMC and USBTMC-488 devices. The driver does not
recognize other USB devices such as mass-storage devices, cameras, and mobile phones.
In this section, USBTMC refers to devices that support the USBTMC or USBTMC-USB488 protocol.
When you use USBTMC, a separate USB cable is necessary for each instrument that is connected to
the host computer.
1. Connect the Type A end of the cable to the host computer.
2. Connect the Type B end of the cable to the Calibrator USB/Control Device port.
3. Turn on the Calibrator. When the host computer detects the Calibrator, it automatically installs the
necessary USBTMC drivers (this is a one-time operation).
4. Make sure that the Calibrator is detected: right-click on the Windows Start icon and select Device
Manager. Under that is USB Test and Measurement Devices and under that, is USB Test and
Measurement Device (IVI).
5. Close the Device Manager on the PC.

### USBTMC Interface

### USBTMC Communication Overview

USBTMC features these endpoints for communication:
• Use Control Endpoint to send standard, class, and vendor-specific requests to the Calibrator.
• Use Bulk Out Endpoint to send USBTMC command messages to the Calibrator.
• The Calibrator uses Bulk In Endpoint to send USBTMC response messages to the controller.
USBTMC-488 adds an additional endpoint called the Interrupt IN Endpoint. The Calibrator uses the
interrupt IN endpoint to send notifications (such as SRQ messages) to the controller. The interrupt IN
endpoint is also used for serial poll requests of the Calibrator. See the Universal Serial Bus Test and
Measurement Class and Universal Serial Bus Test and Measurement Class, subclass USB488
specification for more detailed information.
The USBTMC488 interface implements a full Remote/Local state machine for USBTMC
communication. See the IEEE-488.1 standard section 4.8.2.

### Use USBTMC to Communicate with the Product

For the Calibrator to communicate with the USB device, Fluke Calibration recommends that you use
NI-VISA drivers.
NI-VISA requires a resource string in this format to connect to the correct USB instrument:
USB0::0x0F7E::0x800A::[serial number]::INSTR
Where:
• 0x0F7E: The Fluke vendor ID
• 0x800A: The Calibrator model number (5560A, 5550A, 5540A, or 5530A)
• [serial number]: The serial number of the Calibrator. The serial number is also on the rear panel or
by use of the *IDN? command on one of the other remote interfaces. You can also find the serial
number with the Setup > About menu.
• INSTR: Use the USBTMC protocol.
Note
To ensure the most efficient use of the Service Request (SRQ) mechanism provided by
USBTMC-USB488, first check that the RQS bit in the Status Byte is clear. To do this, perform
a serial poll of the Calibrator before you send any commands that could generate SRQ events.
This only needs to be done once in your program/procedure.
Check communications can be established:
Write *IDN?
Read the response
Clear registers and read the status byte:
Write: *CLS;*RST
Write *ESE 0
Write *SRE 191
Read the status byte (Serial POLL)
Before you proceed, set the event and status registers as required.

### RS-232 Serial Interface

### Use the RS-232 Port for Remote Control

This procedure is intended for those who use the Calibrator serial interface for remote control from a
terminal or computer with a serial interface. This section describes how to set up the RS-232 interface
for remote control with protocol similar to IEEE-488. This section provides all details on data
transmission. The RS-232 interface is designed in accordance with EIA (Electronic Industries
Association) standard RS-232.

### RS-232 Interface Specifications

The RS-232 interface is configured as DTE (Data Terminal Equipment). A null-modem cable with two
female 9-pin subminiature D connectors must be used to connect the Calibrator to other DTE such as a
typical computer serial interface. Fluke Calibration recommends a Fluke RS43 cable.
The choices available and the defaults for all programmable interface parameters for the Calibrator are
shown in Table 2.

### Set up the RS-232 Port for Remote Control

The Calibrator is fully programmable over an RS-232 link with a PC via the rear-panel RS-232 port.
You can enter individual commands from a terminal, write your own programs with a Windows-based
language such as Visual Basic, or run optional Windows-based Fluke software.
The RS-232 cable length for the port should not exceed 15 meters (50 feet). Longer cable lengths are
permitted if the load capacitance measured at a connection point (including the signal terminator) does
not exceed 2500 pF.

### RS-232 Port Setup Procedure

Set up the RS-232 Port from the system menu.
To set RS-232 parameters:
1. Tap the Setup softkey.
2. Select System Settings.
3. Select Remote Port Setup > RS-232.

#### Table 2. RS-232 Interface Parameter Choices

Parameter Choices Default Setting
Data Bits 7 or 8 8
Stop Bits 1 or 2 1
Flow Control Ctrl S/Ctrl Q, (XON/XOFF), RTS, or none Ctrl S/ Ctrl Q
Parity Checking Odd, even, or none None
Baud Rate 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, or 115200 9600
EOL (End of Line) CR, LF, or CR LF CR LF

### Ethernet Interface

### Exceptions for Serial and Ethernet Remote Control

When the RS-232/Ethernet port remotely controls the Calibrator, either interactively with a terminal or
under computer control, operation is the same as with an IEEE-488 controller connected to the IEEE-
488 port for control. These are exceptions:
• Control/C does the same function as DCL (Device Clear) or SDC (Selected Device Clear).
• The EOL (End of Line) input terminator is Carriage Return (Control/M) or Line Feed (Control/J). All
output lines are terminated by the terminator programmed in a setup menu, or set with the remote
command SP_SET. This setting applies to all lines, including those with the *PUD command (see
the next bullet point).
• For the *PUD (Protected User Data) Command, that stores characters for later recall, the serial
remote interface does not store the subsequent characters: Control/C, Line Feed (Control/J),
Carriage Return (Control/M), Control/S (XOFF), Control/Q (XON). These characters are processed
as described above. They cannot be a part of the *PUD command. The *PUD command terminates
with Line Feed or Carriage Return, the same as all other serial remote commands.
• There is no SRQ capability when serial remote control is used. The status registers still behave as
described in this section, but the Calibrator serial interface does not have a way to perform the SRQ
function.
• There are three special commands available only for serial/Ethernet remote control (Remote, Local,
Lockout).

### Ethernet Interface

The subsequent sections describe how to use an Ethernet interface with the Calibrator.

### Set up and Connect the Ethernet Interface

Refer to the specifications for the LAN network, and use this section to set up the Ethernet interface for
the application.
To get to the Ethernet Setup menu, tap Setup > System Settings > Ethernet.
Note
Connect to the LAN network before you make any changes to the Ethernet configuration.
When addressing some LAN addresses, computers often interpret zeros in the IP address as OCTAL
values. As an example, if the IP address is configured from the front panel as 129.196.017.023.
Attempts to establish a connection to 129.196.017.023 can result in a connection request to
129.196.15.19 rather than 129.196.17.23. 017 is interpreted as Octal 17 which is Decimal 15, 023 is
interpreted as Octal 23 which is Decimal 19.
Configure Network Security - Allowed Host IP Addresses
Use the Network Security entries to limit the IP addresses of devices allowed to connect to the 5560A
Ethernet interface. Specify a maximum of three address ranges and enable or disable each range as
needed.

### Set the Starting IP Address

The Starting IP Address is the first IP address allowed to connect to the 5560A.

### Set the Ending IP Address

The Ending IP Address is the last address in the range allowed and must be equal to or greater than
the Starting IP Address. If the ending address and the starting address are equal then only a single
address is allowed.

### Set Range Enable / Disable

Use the Set Range Enable / Disable function to disable the range. If all three ranges are disabled, no
Ethernet access is allowed.

### Set the IP Address

An Internet (IP) address is necessary for all Internet and TCP/IP communications. If DHCP is enabled,
the Calibrator uses the dynamic address supplied by the DHCP server. If the DHCP server fails to
supply the address, the IP address is shown as 0.0.0.0.

### Select the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a client-server protocol that eliminates the manual set
up of permanent/static IP addresses. The DHCP server provides configuration parameters (dynamic IP
address, subnet mask, and default gateway IP addresses) that are necessary for a client to participate
in an IP network.
DHCP is the easiest way to configure the Calibrator for remote communication through the LAN
interface. DHCP is enabled by default when the Calibrator is shipped from the factory. When
connected to a network, and the LAN port is enabled, the Calibrator attempts to retrieve the
parameters from a DHCP server necessary for communications.
To disable or enable DHCP on the Calibrator, from the LAN menu, tap DHCP. If DHCP is already
enabled, ON shows on the selection label.
To use DHCP addressing:
1. Connect a LAN cable from a hub to the LAN port on the back of the Calibrator.
2. Select the ON radio button for DHCP in the Ethernet menu.

### Set a Static Internet Address

The Calibrator comes from the factory with 169.254.001.001 in the static IP address register.
Note
If the Calibrator is to be used on a corporate LAN and DHCP is not used, contact the network
administrator for a static IP address to be used exclusively by the Calibrator. DHCP must be
disabled to set a static IP address.
To change the Calibrator static IP address:
1. Select the Static IP Address box.
2. Use the numeric keypad to enter a new value.
3. Push E.

### Set the LAN Subnet Mask

Note
The IP address is stored in non-volatile memory, and does not change when power is removed
and reapplied to the Calibrator or when the Calibrator receives an *RST command.

### Configure the General Network Socket Port

In order to communicate with each other, a client computer and the Calibrator must use the same
socket port number. The default port is 3490. Typically, the default port does not need to be changed.
If the socket port must be changed, enter the Socket Port number supplied by the network
administrator.
To change the Socket Port number:
1. Tap the Setup softkey.
2. Tap System Settings > Ethernet.
3. In the right column you will see Port with a box where you can enter a new value.
Note
The Network Socket Port Number is stored in non-volatile memory.

### Configure the LAN Default Gateway

The default gateway IP address is the IP address of a gateway (router) attached to the same network
as the device. When the Calibrator detects that a client computer is not on the same network (with the
network number), the data is sent through the gateway to reach the host computer. The default for the
Calibrator is 0 (no gateway, and subnetting is in use).
To set the LAN Default Gateway address:
1. Select the Gateway box from the Ethernet menu.
2. Use the numeric keypad to enter a new value.
3. Push E.

### Set the LAN Subnet Mask

If communication between the client computer and the Calibrator passes through a router or gateway,
and DHCP is disabled, you must set the subnet mask and default gateway address on both the client
computer and the Calibrator. Get the correct subnet mask and gateway address from the network
administrator. The LAN Subnet Mask is a 32-bit number. This number is represented as four 3-digit
segment numbers on the display. The default subnet mask set at the factory is 255.255.255.0.
To change the Calibrator subnet mask:
1. Select the Netmask box.
2. Use the numeric keypad to enter a new value.
3. Push E.

### Read the MAC Address

The MAC Address is set at the factory and cannot be changed. The MAC address can be read from the
Ethernet setup menu. Another way to access the MAC address with a remote connection is to send
the MACADDR? remote command.

### Establish an Ethernet Connection

Note
To connect to the Product, use a category 5 (CAT5) network cable.
Telnet is the easiest method to establish an Ethernet connection with the Calibrator. Telnet is a client-
server protocol, based on TCP. The Telnet Protocol provides a fairly general, bi-directional, eight-bit
byte oriented communications method. Telnet is available on all UNIX servers and on most PCs. The
Windows PUTTY application can also be used.
The LAN connection to the Calibrator must be established with the specified Network Socket Port. See
Configure the General Network Socket Port. When you power on the Calibrator, a LAN server initiates
in the Calibrator that listens for client connections on the socket port at the specified IP address.
To establish a LAN connection to the Calibrator from a computer with either UNIX, LINUX, or MS-DOS
command prompts:
1. At the command prompt on the client computer, enter:
telnet <IP Address> <Socket Port>
As an example, if the IP address is known to be 129.196.136.131 and the Socket Port is set to
3490.
2. At a command prompt from any client computer, enter:
telnet 129.196.136.131 3490
Once the internal LAN server connects with the client computer, the LAN server rejects any other
connection attempts by other computers/clients and will tunnel a channel to the connected
computer. This prevents multiple computers from trying to control the Calibrator.

### Terminate an Ethernet Connection

To terminate the Ethernet connection, terminate the Telnet session on the client computer. Client
Telnet session termination can vary from computer to computer. Typically, if you terminate the shell (or
command window in DOS) this terminates the Telnet session. When the client terminates the Telnet
session, the LAN server in the Calibrator goes back into listen mode and waits for a new client to make
a LAN connection request.

### Ethernet Remote Control

When the Ethernet port is used to remotely control the Calibrator, either interactively with a terminal or
under computer control, operation is the same as with an RS-232 controller connected to the RS-232
port for control.

### Set the LAN Subnet Mask

### Change Between Remote and Local Operation

In addition to local mode (front-panel operation) and remote, the Calibrator can be placed in a local
lockout condition at any time by command of the controller. Combined, the local, remote, and lockout
conditions yield four possible operational states:

### Local State

The Calibrator responds to local and remote commands. This is normal front panel operation. All
remote commands are allowed to execute.

### Local with Lockout State

Local with lockout is identical to local, except the Calibrator will go into the remote with lockout state
instead of the remote state when it receives a remote command.

### Remote State

In the remote state, the display continues to show the output setting or measurement as in local
operation. To put the Calibrator in a remote state, use the RS-232/Ethernet REMOTE command, or
IEEE-488 asserting the REN line or USBTMC sending a REN signal.
The display changes reflect REMOTE CONTROL.
The display shows information about the present output function. However, the Calibrator restricts front
panel operation to use of the power switch and the Go To Local softkey. To return the Calibrator to the
local state:
• Push the Go to Local softkey and use RS-232/Ethernet to send the LOCAL command.
or
• Use IEEE-488/USB to send the GTL (Go To Local) message.

### Remote with Lockout State

In the lockout state, the Calibrator front panel controls are inoperable. To enter the lockout state use
the RS-232/Ethernet LOCKOUT command, or the IEEE-488 message LLO or the USB
LOCAL_LOCKOUT message.
The display shows information about the present output function. However, front panel operation is
restricted to use of the power switch. To return the Calibrator to the local with lockout state, send the
RS-232/Ethernet LOCAL command, or the IEEE-488 GTL (Go To Local) message, or USBTMC
GO_TO_LOCAL message. Only the remote interface that placed the instrument into the LOCKOUT
state, can take the instrument out of the LOCKOUT state.

#### Table 3 summarizes the possible Remote/Local state transitions. (For more information on IEEE-488

(GPIB) messages, see IEEE-488 Bus Communication Overview.

### RS-232 Interface Overview

The RS-232 port is a EIA (Electronic Industries Association) standard RS-232. RS-232 is a serial
binary data interchange that operates from 9600 baud to 115200 baud (selectable), and distances up
to 50 feet. The Calibrator rear-panel RS-232 port is configured as DTE (Data Terminal Equipment).
See Figure 1. See RS-232/IEEE-488 Cables and Connectors.
For detailed information, see the EIA standard RS-232.
A summary of RS-232 terms, interface lines and mnemonics are shown in Table 4.

### IEEE-488 Interface Overview

The IEEE-488 parallel interface sends commands as data and receives measurements and messages
as data. The maximum data exchange rate is 1 Mbyte, with a maximum distance of 20 meters for the
sum length of the cable connections. A single cable should not exceed 4 meters in length. Some
commands are reserved for RS-232/Ethernet operation because these functions must be implemented
as IEEE messages per the IEEE-488.1 Standards. For example, the command REMOTE could be sent

as data over the IEEE-488 interface to place the Calibrator into remote, but the message is not sent as
data because the IEEE Standards call for the remote function to be sent to the device as the uniline
message REN. This is also true for several other commands and functions, as shown below, with their
equivalent RS-232/Ethernet emulation. A summary of IEEE-488 messages is shown in Table 7.

#### Table 7. RS-232/Ethernet Emulation of IEEE-488 Messages

The IEEE-488 interface is based on the IEEE Standards 488.1 (GPIB) and 488.2. For detailed
information, refer to the standards IEEE-488.1 (GPIB) and IEEE-488.2.
IEEE-488.1 IEEE-488.1 (GPIB) is the hardware portion of the interface. The parallel signal lines are
divided into eight lines for the data bus, three lines for the handshake, and five lines for bus
management. The handshake lines take care of the timing for data exchange. The bus management
lines control the operation of data exchange. The ATN line indicates the use of the DIO lines for
addresses or messages (true), or for DIO data (false). The EOI line is used with the data lines to mark
the end of a message, and with the ATN line for polling. The SRQ line is used by the devices to indicate
to the controller that they require service. The IFC line is used by the controller to quickly get all the
devices on the bus to stop talking and start listening. The REN line is used to implement the remote/
local states.
IEEE-488.2 IEEE-488.2 is the software portion of the interface, that specifies data formats, common
commands, message exchange protocol and the status register implementation.

### USBTMC Interface Overview

The USBTMC interface uses the bulk-out endpoint to send GPIB ATN=FALSE program messages to
the Calibrator. The bulk-out endpoint is also used to send trigger command messages to the Calibrator.
The bulk-in endpoint receives GPIB ATN=FALSE response messages from the Calibrator.
The Calibrator uses the interrupt-in endpoint to request service (it sends an SRQ message to the
controller) and to communicate the status byte register value. The SRQ condition communicated
automatically whenever the RQS bit is set in the Status Byte Register.
The control endpoint is used to send initiate clear (DCL,SDC) messages, REN enable messages
(REN), GO_TO_LOCAL (GTL), LOCAL_LOCKOUT (LLO) and READ_STATUS_BYTE (SPL).

## How to Use Commands

Communications between the controller and the Calibrator consists of commands, queries, and
interface messages. Although the commands are based on the 488.2 standard, they can be used on
either the IEEE-488, USBTMC, Ethernet or RS-232 interface, except for a few specialized RS-232/
Ethernet commands described in Commands for RS-232/Ethernet Only. (For more information on
command structures, see the IEEE 488.2 standard.)
Refer to Remote Commands when you require additional information about command references used
this section.
All commands and units may be entered in UPPER or lower case.
There are four specific remote control configurations that use commands, queries and interface
messages: IEEE-488/GPIB, USBTMC, RS-232/Ethernet Terminal function, and RS-232/Ethernet
Computer Mode.
IEEE-488/GPIB Mode Use the IEEE-488/GPIB mode when the Calibrator is operated by computer
program. In this mode, requested information is returned by query, and interface messages are queued
and returned by command.
USBTMC Mode Use the USBTMC mode when the Calibrator is operated by computer program. In this
mode, requested information is returned by query, and interface messages are queued and returned
by command.
RS-232/Ethernet Terminal Mode The RS-232 and/or Ethernet terminal mode is an interactive mode
where an operator inputs commands, with immediate returns for requested information (queries) and
interface messages.
RS-232/Ethernet Computer Mode Use the RS-232 and/or Ethernet computer mode when the Calibrator
is operated by computer program. In this mode, requested information is returned by query, and
interface messages are queued and returned by command.

## How to Use Commands

### Types of Commands

The Calibrator can group commands into one or more categories, depending on how they function.
Each category is described below.

### Device-Dependent Commands

Device-dependent commands are unique to the Calibrator. An example of a device-dependent
command is,
OUT 100 V, 1 A, 60 HZ
this instructs the Calibrator to source 100 watts of ac power.

### Common Commands

Common commands are defined by the IEEE 488.2 standard and are common to most bus devices.
Common commands always begin with an * (asterisk) character. Common commands are available
whether you use the IEEE-488, USBTMC, RS-232 or Ethernet interface for remote control. An example
of a common command is,
*IDN?
this instructs the Calibrator to return the instrument identification string.

### Query Commands

Query commands request information, which is returned as the command executes (RS-232/Ethernet),
or placed in a buffer until requested (GPIB/USBTMC). An example of a query, which always end with a
question mark, is,
RANGE?
this instructs the Calibrator primary and secondary (if in dual output function) range values.

### Interface Messages (IEEE-488)

Interface messages manage traffic on the IEEE-488 interface bus. Device addressing and clearing,
data handshaking, and commands to place status bytes on the bus are all directed by interface
messages. Some of the interface messages occur as state transitions of dedicated control lines. The
rest of the interface messages are sent over the data lines with the ATN signal true. (All device-
dependent and common commands are sent over the data lines with the ATN signal false.)
Note that interface messages, unlike device-dependent and common commands, are not sent literally
(in a direct way). For example, when you send a device-dependent query to the Calibrator, the
controller automatically sends the interface message MTA (My Talk Address).
IEEE-488 standards define interface messages. Table 9 lists the interface messages that the
Calibrator accepts. Table 10 lists the interface messages that the Calibrator sends. The interface
messages that the Calibrator sends are also listed. The mnemonics listed in the tables are not sent as
literal statements as commands are. In this way they are different from device-dependent and common
commands.
Interface messages are handled automatically in most cases. For example, handshake messages
DAV, DAC, and RFD automatically occur under the direction of an instrument's interface itself as each
byte is sent over the bus.

#### Table 9. IEEE-488 Interface Messages (Received)

Mnemonic Name Function
ATN Attention
A control line that, when asserted, notifies all instruments on
the bus that the next data bytes are an interface message.
When ATN is low, the next data bytes are interpreted as
device-dependent or common commands addressed to a
specific instrument.
DAC Data Accepted Set the handshake signal line NDAC low.
DAV Data Valid Asserts the handshake signal line DAV.
DCL Device Clear Clears the input/output buffers.
END End A message that occurs when the Controller asserts the EOIsignal line before it sends a byte.
GET Group ExecuteTriggerTrigger a TC measurement and put the reading in the outputbuffer.
GTL Go To Local Transfer control of the Calibrator from one of the remotestates to one of the local states. (See Table 3)
LLO Local Lockout Transfers remote/local control of the Calibrator. (See Table 3)
IFC Interface Clear A control line that sets the interface to a quiescent state.
MLA My ListenAddress
Addresses a specific device on the bus as a listener. The
controller sends MLA automatically whenever it directs a
device-dependent or common command to a specific
instrument.
MTA My Talk Address
Addresses a specific device on the bus as a talker. The
controller sends MTA automatically whenever it directs a
device-dependent or common query to a specific instrument.
REN Remote Enable Transfer remote/local control of the Calibrator. (See Table 3)
RFD Ready For Data Set the handshake signal line NRFD low.
SDC Selected DeviceClearDoes the same as DCL, but only if the Calibrator is currentlyaddressed as a listener.
SPD Serial Poll Disable Cancels the effect of a Serial Poll Enable.
SPE Serial Poll Enable
After the Calibrator receives this message, it sends the Status
Byte the next it is addressed as a listener, no matter what the
command is.
UNL Unlisten
Unaddresses a specific device on the bus as a listener. The
controller sends UNL automatically after the device has
successfully received a device-dependent or common
command.
UNT Untalk
Unaddresses a specific device on the bus as a listener. The
controller sends UNL automatically after the device has
successfully received a device-dependent or common query.

## How to Use Commands

### Compound Commands

A compound command is two or more commands in a single command line. For example, these two
commands could be entered individually,
OUT 1 V, 60 HZ
OPER
where the Calibrator sources 1 V ac at 60 Hz, and then goes into operate, or they could be combined
into a compound command, that uses a semi-colon as a separator.
OUT 1 V, 60 HZ ; OPER
Use care when a compound command includes any of the coupled commands. (See Coupled
Commands)

### Coupled Commands

A coupled command refers to two or more commands that appear in a compound command (see
Compound Commands) that perform actions that could interfere with each other and cause a fault.
Commands in a compound command are separated by the use of the ; character. Compound
commands that use only coupled commands are not order-dependent.
In Remote Commands, the command shows a checkbox for coupled commands.
The coupled commands are:
An example of the coupled command interference is the command
*RST; *WAI; OUT 100V, 1kHZ; WAVE SINE

#### Table 10. IEEE-488 Interface Messages (Sent)

Mnemonic Name Function
END End
A message that occurs when the Calibrator asserts the EOI
control line. The Calibrator asserts EOI while it transmits the
ASCII character LF for its termination sequence or terminator.
DAC Data Accepted Set the handshake signal line NDAC low.
DAV Data Valid Asserts the handshake signal line DAV.
RFD Ready for Data Set the handshake line NRFD low.
SRQ Service Request
A control line that any device on the bus can assert to indicate
that it requires attention. See Check Product Status for
details.
STB Status Byte The status byte is what the Calibrator sends when it respondsto a serial poll (interface message SPE).
DBMZ
DC_OFFSET
HARMONIC
OUT
OUT_IMP
RANGE
TMWAVE
TRIG
VIDEOFMT
VIDEOMARK
WAVE
Followed by the commands
WAVE TRI
OUT 10V, 1kHZ
The WAVE TRI causes an error. At 100 V, only sine waves are allowed. Both WAVE and OUT are
coupled commands. So, the compound command
WAVE TRI; OUT 10V, 1kHZ
executes successfully. The WAVE and OUT are programmed together and at 10 V, triangle waves are
allowed.

### Overlapped Commands

Commands that begin execution, but require slightly more time to complete, are called overlapped
commands because they can be overlapped by the next command before they have completed
execution.
In Remote Commands, the command shows a checkbox for overlapped commands.
The overlapped commands, excluding scope commands, are:
You can use the command *WAI to wait until the overlapped command has completed execution
before you execute the next command. For example,
OUT 1 V, 1 A, 60 HZ ; *WAI
You can also use the status commands *OPC and *OPC? to detect completion of overlapped
commands, see Check Product Status.

### Sequential Commands

Commands that execute immediately are called sequential commands.
In Remote Commands, the command shows a checkbox for sequential commands.
The majority of the commands are sequential.
BOOST LOWS RTD_TYPE
DBMZ MULT STBY
DC_OFFSET OLDREF SYNCOUT
DPF OPER TC_OFFSET
DUTY OUT TC_OTCD
EXTGUARD PHASE TC_REF
EXTSENSE POST_52120 TC_TYPE
HARMONIC RANGELCK TSENS_TYPE
INCR REFPHASE WAVE
LCOMP_52120 *RST ZCOMP

## How to Use Commands

### Combining Overlapped and Coupled Commands within a Compound Command

When a compound command contains a mix of overlapped and coupled commands, a *WAI
command used to allow a previous overlapped command to complete can interfere with coupled
command operation: *WAI decouples any coupled command ahead of it from those that follow.
When a compound command contains an overlapped command, which necessitates the use of *WAI
to allow the overlapped command to complete, a *WAI should only follow the overlapped command if
the next command in the compound command is not a coupled command.
For example, in this compound command sequence: OUT 1V, 10HZ; WAVE SQUARE; DC_OFFSET
0V; *WAI; DUTY 50; *OPC?
Although OUT, WAVE_SQUARE, and DC_OFFSET are all overlapped commands which would typically be
followed by *WAI, they are also coupled commands. To remain coupled, they must not be separated
by an intervening *WAI.
DC_OFFSET 0V is also an overlapped command, but can be followed by *WAI because the command
that follows, DUTY 50, is not a coupled command.
DUTY 50 is also an overlapped command, and since it ends the sequence, a *WAI could be used to
terminate the compound command. Instead, use *OPC? which provides a response that indicates
when the sequence completes.
Within a compound command, only insert *WAI after an overlapped command when the next
command is not a coupled command.

### Commands that Require You to Unsecure the Calibrator

These commands do not work unless the Calibrator has been unsecured with the cal_secure
command:
CLOCK (when you set date but not time)
*PUD
RPT_STR
CAL_PASSCODE
VER_DATE
VER_TEMP
If you attempt to use any of these commands with the Calibrator in a secure state, the Calibrator logs
an error into the error queue. (Or it returns the error message if in the RS-232/Ethernet Terminal
Mode.)

### Commands for RS-232/Ethernet Only

The RS-232/Ethernet checkbox indicates RS-232 and/or Ethernet interface commands.
The IEEE-488, USBTMC, Ethernet and RS-232 interfaces all send commands to the Calibrator as
data, except for those IEEE-488 functions that must be implemented as a message as specified in the
IEEE-488 standards. For example, the RS-232 and Ethernet interfaces use the command REMOTE to
place the Calibrator in the remote mode. Although the IEEE-488 interface could also send a command
REMOTE as data, it does not because this is one of the functions that must be implemented per IEEE-
488.1 Standard. The relationship between these IEEE-488 messages and the equivalent RS-232/
Ethernet emulation is shown in Table 11.
In addition to the commands and special characters that emulate the IEEE-488 functions shown above,
there are several more commands that are related to operation and control of the actual RS-232 or
Ethernet port and are therefore completely unrelated to IEEE-488/USBTMC operations. These include
these commands.
SP_SET SRQSTR?

### Commands for IEEE-488 Only

The IEEE-488 checkbox indicates commands that are used for the IEEE-488 interface. This is all of the
commands, except for those used for RS-232/Ethernet operations, see Commands for RS-232/
Ethernet Only. All commands are transferred over the IEEE-488 as data, except for the commands
LOCAL, REMOTE, and LOCKOUT. These are implemented per IEEE-488.1 Standard as messages,
see Table 12.

### Command Syntax

The syntax rules below apply to all the remote commands. Information about syntax of response
messages is also given.

### Parameter Syntax Rules

#### Table 13 lists the units accepted in command parameters and used in responses. All commands and

units may be entered in UPPER or lower case.

#### Table 13. Units Accepted in Parameters and Used in Responses

Units Meaning
HZ Frequency in units of hertz

MHZ Frequency in units of megahertz
UV Volts in units of microvolts
MV Volts in units of millivolts
V Volts in units of volts
KV Volts in units of kilovolts

CEL Temperature in degrees Celsius
FAR Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
NS Period in units of nanoseconds
US Period in units of microseconds
MS Period in units of milliseconds
S Period in units of seconds
General Rules The general rules for parameter usage is as follows:
• When a command has more than one parameter, the parameters must be separated by commas.
For example: OUT 1V, 2A.
• Numeric parameters may have up to 15 significant digits and their exponents can be in the range
±1.0E±20.
• Including too many or too few parameters causes a command error.
• Missing parameters cause an error, for example, the adjacent commas in OUT 1V, ,2A.
• Expressions, for example 4+2*13, are not allowed as parameters.
• Binary Block Data can be in one of two forms: Indefinite Length and Definite Length format (both
IEEE-488.2 standards).
Indefinite Length The Indefinite Length format accepts data bytes after the #0 until the ASCII Line
Feed character is received with an EOI signal (for RS-232 or Ethernet, just a line feed or carriage
return will terminate the block).
Definite Length The Definite Length format specifies the number of data bytes. The data bytes are
preceded by #n and an n-digit number. The n-digit number identifies how many data bytes follow. For
examples, see the *PUD command descriptions in Remote Commands.

### Extra Space or Tab Characters

In the command descriptions in the Remote Commands section, parameters are shown separated by
spaces. One space after a command is required (unless no parameters are required). All other spaces
are optional. Spaces are inserted for clarity in the manual and may be left in or omitted. You can insert
extra spaces or tabs between parameters. Extra spaces within a parameter are generally not allowed,
except for between a number and its associated prefix or unit. See Remote Commands for examples of
commands whose parameters or responses are not self-explanatory.

### Terminators

#### Table 14 summarizes the terminator characters for the IEEE-488, USBTMC, Ethernet and RS-232

remote interfaces.

## How to Use Commands

IEEE-488 Interface The Calibrator sends the ASCII character Line Feed with the EOI control line held
high as the terminator for response messages. The Calibrator recognizes these as terminators when
encountered in incoming data:
• ASCII LF character
• Any ASCII character sent with the EOI control line asserted
RS-232 and Ethernet Interface The Calibrator returns an EOL (End of Line) character with each
response to the PC. This is selectable as Carriage Return (CR), Line Feed (LF) or both CRLF, see RS-
232 Port Setup Procedure. Commands sent to the Calibrator must end in either a CR or LF, or both.

### Incoming Character Processing

The Calibrator processes all incoming data as follows (except Binary Block Data as described in
Parameter Syntax Rules):
• The most significant data bit (DIO8) is ignored.
• All data is taken as 7-bit ASCII.
• Lower-case or upper-case characters are accepted.
• ASCII characters whose decimal equivalent is <32 (Space) are discarded, except for characters 10
(LF) and 13 (CR) and in the *PUD command argument. Binary Block Data allows all characters in its
argument and terminates in a special way.

### Response Message Syntax

In the command descriptions in Remote Commands, responses from the Calibrator are described
wherever appropriate. In order to know what type of data to read in, refer to the first part of the entry
under Response in the tables. The response is identified as one of the data types in Table 15.

#### Table 15. Response Data Types

Data Type Description
Integer
Integers for some controllers or computers are decimal numbers in the
range -32768 to 32768.
Responses in this range are labeled Integer.
Example: *ESE 123; *ESE?
returns: 123
Floating
Numbers that may have up to 15 significant figures plus an exponent
that may range from ±E20.
Example: DC_OFFSET?
returns: 1.4293E+00
String
Any ASCII characters including quotation mark delimiters.
Example: RPT_STR Fluke 5560A;RPT_STR?
returns: Fluke 5560A
Character Response Data
(CRD)
This type of response is always a keyword.
Example: OUT 10V, 100HZ; FUNC?
returns: ACV
Indefinite ASCII (IAD)
Any ASCII characters followed by EOM. Queries with this type of
response MUST be the last Query in a program message.
Example: *OPT?
returns: SC600
CAL reports and lists which contains Line Feeds are typically of this
type.
Binary Block Data
A special data type defined by the IEEE-488.2 standard. This type is
used in *PUD? query. It is defined as follows:
#(non-zero digit) (digits) (user data)
The non-zero digit specifies the number of characters that will follow in
the <digits> field. Characters allowed in the digits field are 0 through 9
(ASCII 48 through 57 decimal). The value of the number in the <digits>
field in decimal defines the number of user data bytes that follow in the
<user data> field. The maximum response is 64 characters.
Example: *PUD "test1"; *PUD?
returns: #205test1

## Check Product Status

The programmer has access to status registers, enable registers, and queues in the Calibrator to
indicate various conditions in the instrument as shown in Figure 4. Some registers and queues are
defined by the IEEE-488.2 standard. The rest are specific to the Calibrator. In addition to the status
registers, the Service Request (SRQ) control line, and a 16-element buffer called the Error Queue
provide status information. Table 16 lists the status registers and gives the read/write commands and
associated mask registers.
Each status register and queue has a summary bit in the Status Byte Register. Enable registers are
used to mask various bits in the status registers and generate summary bits in the Status Byte
Register. For IEEE-488/USBTMC interface operation, the Service Request Enable Register is used to
assert the SRQ control line (or SRQ Interrupt in USBTMC) on detection of any status condition or
conditions the programmer chooses. For RS-232/Ethernet interface operation, the SRQSTR string is
sent over the interface when the RQS/MSS bit is set in the Status Byte Register. See the SRQSTR?
command description in Remote Commands for more information.

### Status Byte Register (STB)

The Calibrator sends the Status Byte Register (STB) when it responds to a serial poll. This byte is
cleared (set to 0) when the power is turned on. The STB byte is defined as shown in Figure 4. If you
use the RS-232 or Ethernet as the remote control interface, transmitting the ^P character (in the
Terminal mode, hold down the <Cntl> key and push P) returns the SPLSTR Serial Poll String; the
status byte and Event Status Register). Refer to the *STB? command, and for RS-232/Ethernet
interface operation, the SPLSTR? command, in Remote Commands.

## Check Product Status

### Service Request (SRQ) Line

IEEE-488 Service Request (SRQ) is an IEEE-488.1 (GPIB) bus control line that the Calibrator asserts
to notify the controller that it requires some type of service. Many instruments can be on the bus, but
they all share a single SRQ line. To determine which instrument set SRQ, the Controller normally does
a serial poll of each instrument. The Calibrator asserts SRQ whenever the RQS bit in its Status Byte
Register is 1. This bit informs the controller that the Calibrator was the source of the SRQ.
RS-232/Ethernet Remote operations that use the RS-232 or Ethernet interface emulate the IEEE-488
SRQ line by sending the SRQSTR string over the serial interface when the RQS/MSS bit is set in the
Status Byte Register. See the SRQSTR? command description in Remote Commands.
The Calibrator clears SRQ and RQS whenever the controller/host performs a serial poll, sends *CLS,
or whenever the MSS bit is cleared. The MSS bit is cleared only when ESB, MAV, EAV, and ISCB are
0, or they are disabled by their associated enable bits in the SRE register being set to 0.
USBTMC The Calibrator uses the interrupt-in endpoint to request service (by sending a SRQ message
to the controller) and to communicate the status byte register value. The SRQ condition communicates
automatically whenever the RQS bit is set in the Status Byte Register.

#### Table 17. Status Byte Register (STB) and Service Request Enable (SRE)

7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
RQS
ESB MAV EAV ISCB 0 0
MSS
RQS Requesting service. The RQS bit is set to 1 whenever bits ESB, MAV, EAV, or ISCB
change from 0 to 1 and are enabled (1) in the SRE. When RQS is 1, the Calibrator asserts
the SRQ control line on the IEEE-488 interface or sends a SRQ request message when it
uses USBTMC. You can do a serial poll and read this bit to see if the Calibrator is the
source of an SRQ.
MSS Master summary status. Set to 1 whenever bits ESB, MAV, EAV, or ISCB are 1 and
enabled (1) in the SRE. This bit can be read with the *STB? command in RS-232/
Ethernet remote control in place of doing a serial poll.
ESB Set to 1 when one or more enabled ESR bits are 1.
MAV Message available. The MAV bit is set to 1 whenever data is available in the IEEE-488
interface output buffer of the Calibrator.
EAV Error available. An error has occurred and an error is available to be read from the error
queue.Use the ERR? query.
ISCB One or more enable ISCR bits are 1.

### Service Request Enable Register (SRE)

The Service Request Enable Register (SRE) enables or masks the bits of the Status Byte Register.
The SRE is cleared at power up. See Table 17 for the bit functions.

### Program the STB and SRE

If you reset (to 0) the bits in the SRE, you can mask (disable) associated bits in the Status Byte
Register. Bits set to 1 enable the associated bit in the Status Byte Register. The sample BASIC
program below enables the Error Available (EAV) bit.
10 ! THIS PROGRAM SETS EAV IN THE SRE
20 PRINT @4,"*SRE 8" ! LOAD THE REGISTER
30 PRINT @4, "*SRE?" ! ASK FOR THE SRE CONTENTS
40 INPUT @4, A% ! RETRIEVE THE REGISTER CONTENTS
50 PRINT "SRE = ";A%
60 RETURN
The BASIC program below generates an error and checks the Status Byte Register. Enable the
EAV bit with the example above.
10 ! THIS PROGRAM GENERATES AN ERROR AND CHECKS IT
20 PRINT @4, "OUT 1300V" ! 1300V IS OUT OF 5560A RANGE
30 A% = SPL(4) ! DO A SERIAL POLL
40 IF ((A% AND 72%)=0%)THEN PRINT "EAV and RQS should have been set"
50 PRINT @4, "*STB?" ! RETRIEVE BYTE
60 INPUT @4, A%
70 IF ((A% AND 8%)=0%) THEN PRINT "EAV should have been set"

### Event Status Register (ESR)

The Event Status Register is a two-byte register in which the higher eight bits are always 0, and the
lower eight bits represent various conditions of the Calibrator. The ESR is cleared (set to 0) when the
power is turned on, and every time it is read.
Many of the remote commands require parameters. Improper use of parameters causes command
errors to occur. When a command error occurs, bit CME (5) in the Event Status Register (ESR) goes to
1, and the error is logged in the error queue.

### Event Status Enable (ESE) Register

A mask register called the Event Status Enable register (ESE) allows the controller to enable or mask
(disable) each bit in the ESR. When a bit in the ESE is 1, the corresponding bit in the ESR is enabled.
When any enabled bit in the ESR is 1, the ESB bit in the Status Byte Register also goes to 1. The ESR
bit stays 1 until the controller reads the ESR or does a device clear, a selected device clear, or sends
the reset or *CLS command to the Calibrator. The ESE is cleared (set to 0) when the power is turned
on.

## Check Product Status

### Bit Assignments for the ESR and ESE

The bits in the Event Status Register (ESR) and Event Status Enable register (ESE) are assigned as
shown in Table 18.

### Program the ESR and ESE

To read the contents of the ESR, send the remote command, *ESR?. The ESR is cleared (set to 0)
every time it is read. To read the contents of the ESE, send the remote command, *ESE?. The ESE is
not cleared when it is read. When you read either register, the Calibrator sends a decimal number that
when converted to binary represents bits 0 through 15. The sample BASIC program below retrieves the
contents of both registers:
10 ! THIS PROGRAM READS THE ESR AND THE ESE REGISTERS
20 PRINT @4, "*ESR?" ! ASK FOR THE ESR CONTENTS
30 INPUT @4, A% ! RETRIEVE THE REGISTER CONTENTS
40 PRINT @4, "*ESE?" ! ASK FOR THE ESE CONTENTS
50 INPUT @4, B% ! RETRIEVE THE REGISTER CONTENTS
60 PRINT "ESR = ";A% ! DISPLAY THE ESR REGISTER CONTENTS VALUE
70 PRINT "ESE = ";B% ! DISPLAY THE ESE REGISTER CONTENTS VALUE
80 END

#### Table 18. Event Status Register (ESR) and Event Status Enable (ESE)

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
PON 0 CME EXE DDE QYE 0 OPC
PON Power on. This bit is set to 1 if line power has been turned off and on since the last time the
ESR was read.
CME Command error. The Calibrator encountered an incorrectly formed command. (The
command ERR? fetches the earliest error code in the error queue, which contains error
codes for the first 15 errors that have occurred.).
EXE Execution error. An error occurred while the Calibrator tried to execute the last command.
For example, when a parameter is out of range. (The command
ERR? fetches the earliest error in the error queue, which contains error codes for the first
15 errors that have occurred.).
DDE Device-dependent error. An error related to a device-dependent command has occurred.
QYE Query error. The Calibrator was addressed to talk when no response data was available or
appropriate, or when the controller failed to retrieve data on the output queue.
OPC Operation complete. All commands previous to reception of a *OPC command have been
executed, and the interface is ready to accept another message.
Convert the contents of variables A and B into binary, and you can read the status of the registers. For
example if A is 32, its binary equivalent is: 00000000 00100000. Therefore, bit 5 (CME) in the ESR is
set (1) and the rest of the bits are reset (0). This means that the Calibrator received an incorrectly
formed command.
If you set the bits in the ESE, you can mask (disable) the associated bits in the ESR. For example, to
prevent the occurrence of a command error from causing bit 5 (ESB) in the Status Byte Register to go
to 1, you can reset (to 0) bit 5 in the ESE register. The sample program below accomplishes this. This
program checks the status of the CME bit, then toggles it if it is 1.
10 ! THIS PROGRAM RESETS BIT 5 (CME) IN THE ESE
20 PRINT @4,"*ESE 33" ! INITIAL ESE IS CME + OPC
30 GOSUB 100 ! GET AND PRINT INITIAL ESE
40 IF (A% AND 32%) THEN A% = A% - 32% ! CLEAR CME (BIT 5)
50 PRINT @4, "*ESE ";A% ! LOAD ESE WITH NEW VALUE
60 GOSUB 100 ! GET AND PRINT NEW ESE
70 END
100 PRINT @4, "*ESE?" ! ASK FOR ESE CONTENTS
110 INPUT @4, A% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS
120 PRINT "ESE = ";A%
130 RETURN

### Instrument Status Register (ISR)

The Instrument Status Register (ISR) gives the controller access to the state of the Calibrator, including
some of the information presented to the operator on the display and the annunciators shown during
local operation.

### Instrument Status Change Registers

There are two registers dedicated to monitoring changes in the ISR. These are the ISCR0 (Instrument
Status 1-0 Change Register) and the ISCR1 (Instrument Status 0-1 Change Register). Each status
change register has an associated mask register. Each ISCR is cleared (set to 0) when the Calibrator
is turned on, every time it is read, and at each *CLS (Clear Status) command.

### Instrument Status Change Enable Registers

The Instrument Status Change Enable registers (ISCE0 and ISCE1) are mask registers for the ISCR0
and ISCR1 registers. If a bit in the ISCE is enabled (set to 1) and the corresponding bit in the ISCR
makes the appropriate transition, the ISCB bit in the Status Byte is set to 1. If all bits in the ISCE are
disabled (set to 0), the ISCB bit in the Status Byte never goes to 1. The contents of the ISCE registers
are set to 0 at power-up.

### Bit Assignments for the ISR, ISCR, and ISCE

The bits in the Instrument Status, Instrument Status Change, and Instrument Status Change Enable
registers are assigned as shown in Table 19.

## Check Product Status

#### Table 19. Bit Assignments for the ISR, ISCEs, and ISCR

### Program the ISR, ISCR, and ISCE

To read the contents of the ISR, send the remote command, ISR?. To read the contents of the ISCR0
or 1, send the remote command, ISCR0?, or ISCR1?. To read the contents of the ISCE0 or 1, send the
remote command, ISCE0?, or ISCE1?. The Calibrator sends a decimal number that represents bits 0
through 15. Every time you read the ISCR0 or 1, its contents are zeroed. The sample program below
reads all five registers:
10 ! THIS PROGRAM READS THE ISR, ISCR, AND ISCE REGISTERS
20 ! NOTE THAT THE ICSR? COMMANDS CLEAR THE ISCR CONTENTS
30 PRINT @4, "ISR?" ! ASK ISR CONTENTS
40 INPUT @4,A% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS FROM 5560A
50 PRINT @4, "ISCR0?" ! ASK FOR AND CLEAR ISCR0 CONTENTS
60 INPUT @4, B% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS FROM 5560A
70 PRINT @4, "ISCE0?" ! ASK FOR ISCE0 CONTENTS
80 INPUT @4, C% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS FROM 5560A
50 PRINT @4, "ISCR1?" ! ASK FOR AND CLEAR ISCR1 CONTENTS
60 INPUT @4, D% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS FROM 5560A
70 PRINT @4, "ISCE1?" ! ASK FOR ISCE1 CONTENTS
80 INPUT @4, E% ! RETRIEVE REGISTER CONTENTS FROM 5560A
90 PRINT "ISR = ";A% ! DISPLAY ISR
100 PRINT "ISCR0 = ";B% ! DISPLAY ISCR0
110 PRINT "ISCE0 = ";C% ! DISPLAY ISCE0
100 PRINT "ISCR1 = ";D% ! DISPLAY ISCR1
110 PRINT "ISCE1 = ";E% ! DISPLAY ISCE1
120 END
15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8
0 0 BOOST SETTLED REMOTE TRIPPED 0 0
7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
HIVOLT 0 0 0 0 0 0 OPER
BOOST When 1, 52120 amplifier is active.
SETTLED Set to 1 when the output has stabilized to within specification or the TC measurement
has settled and is available.
REMOTE Set to 1 when the Calibrator is under remote control.
TRIPPED Set to 1 whenever operate reverts to standby due to an error.Value resets to 0 when
the Product re-enters Operate or when RESET (or *RST).
HIVOLT Set to 1 when the Calibrator is programmed to a voltage above 30 V.
OPER Set to 1 when the Calibrator is in operate, 0 when it is in standby.
Convert the returned variables into binary, and you can read the status of the instrument. For example
if a register contains 128, its binary equivalent is: 00000000 10000000. Therefore, bit 7 (HIVOLT) is set
(1) and the rest of the bits are reset (0).
If you set the bits in an ISCE register, you can mask (disable) the associated bits in the ISCR. For
example, to cause an SRQ interrupt when the output has settled, bit 12 (SETTLED) in the ISCE1
register must be 1. (The ISCB bit must also be enabled in the SRE.) The sample program below loads
a decimal 1024 into the ISCE, which sets bit 12 and resets the other bits:
10 ! THIS PROGRAM LOADS 00010000 00000000 BINARY INTO THE ISCE
20 PRINT @4, "ISCE 4096" ! LOAD DECIMAL 4096 INTO ISCE
30 PRINT @4, "ISCE?" ! READ BACK ISCE VALUE
40 INPUT @4, A% ! "
50 PRINT "ISCE = ";A% ! PRINT IT, IT SHOULD BE 4096
60 END

### Output Queue

The output queue is loaded whenever a query is processed, and holds up to 800 characters. The
controller reads it with a statement such as a BASIC INPUT statement, and removes what it reads from
the queue. If the queue is empty, the Calibrator does not respond to the INPUT statement from the
controller. The Message Available (MAV) bit in the Status Byte Register is 1 if there is something in the
output queue and 0 if the output queue is empty.

### Error Queue

When a command error, execution error, or device-dependent error occurs, its error code is placed in
the error queue where it can be read by the ERR? command. A way to decode an error code is to send
the command, EXPLAIN?, which returns a description of a error code. Reading the first error with the
ERR? command removes that error from the queue. A response of 0 means the error queue is empty.
The Error Available (EAV) bit in the Status Byte Register indicates whether the queue is empty. The
error queue is cleared when you turn off the power, and when you use the *CLS (Clear Status)
common command.
The error queue contains up to 16 entries. If many errors occur, only the first 15 errors are kept in the
queue. A 16th entry in the queue is always an error queue overflow error, and all later errors are
discarded until the queue is at least partially read. The first errors are kept, because if many errors
occur before the user can acknowledge and read them, the earliest errors are the most likely to point to
the problem. The later errors are usually repetitions or consequences of the original problem.

## Remote Program Examples

The programming examples below illustrate ways to handle errors, to take measurements, take a
number of successive readings, lock the range, and calibrate the Calibrator. These excerpts from
programs are written in DOS BASIC.

## Remote Program Examples

### Guidelines for Programming the Calibrator

Commands are processed one at a time as they are received. Some commands require a previous
condition be set before the command will be accepted by the Calibrator. For example, the waveform
must be SQUARE before the DUTY command will be accepted. Use the programming guidelines
below to ensure that the output is programmed as necessary.
Program all external connections first. The Calibrator is placed in standby. Change the output to
accommodate the new external connection.You can make the setting even if the present output does
not use the setting (for example, setting the thermocouple type while sourcing voltage).
Next, program the output and output function next with the OUT command.
• All other output parameters such as impedance compensation, offset, and waveforms should be
programmed next. The DUTY command must follow the WAVE command.
• Check the error status with the ERR? command.
• Finally, put the Calibrator into operate mode with the OPER command.
A controller program first initializes the interface and the Calibrator. Refer to this sample program:
10 INIT PORT 0 \ REMOTE @4 ! PUT THE 5560A INTO THE REMOTE STATE
20 PRINT @4, "*RST; *WAI; OUT 10V; *WAI; OPER" ! RESET THE 5560A, PROGRAM
IT TO 10 VDC
To use SRQs, first use the *SRE, *ESE, and ISCE commands to enable the desired event, see Check
Product Status.
Retrieve instrument parameters with a query (a programming command that ends with a question
mark):
200 PRINT @4, "FUNC?" ! RETRIEVE OUTPUT FUNCTION
210 INPUT LINE @4, A$
220 PRINT "Function is: "; A$
230 PRINT @4, "ONTIME?" ! RETRIEVE ON TIME
240 INPUT LINE @4, A$
250 PRINT "The instrument has been on for "; A$;" minutes"
This program generates this sample output:
Function is: DCV
The instrument has been on for 134 minutes
Check for programming errors as in these sample programs. Check the Error Available (EAV) bit in the

### Writing an SRQ and Error Handler

It is good practice to include fault (error) handling routines in your applications. The sample program
lines below show a method to halt program execution on occurrence of an SRQ (Service Request) on
the bus, check to see if the Calibrator is the source of the SRQ, retrieve its fault messages, and act on
the faults. Modify and extend this code as necessary for your application.
If you want to use SRQs, first use the *SRE, *ESE, and ISCE commands to enable the desired event.
See Check Product Status.
10 INIT PORT0 ! IFC the bus
20 CLEAR PORT0 ! DCL the bus
30 ! INITIALIZE THE 5560A SRQ HANDLER
40 PRINT @4, "*SRE 8" ! Enable STB.EAV (error available)
50 ON SRQ GOTO 1100 ! Install SRQ handler
60 ! Body of the application goes here
1100 ! Bus SRQ handler
1110 CLEAR PORT0 ! Make sure devices are not
confused
1120 IF (SPL(4) AND 64) THEN GOSUB 1200 ! If (STB.RQS) call SRQ
1130 ! TEST OTHER DEVICES RQS BITS IF DESIRED
1140 RESUME
1200 ! 5560A SRQ handler
1210 IF (SPL(4) AND 8) THEN GOSUB 1300 ! If (STB.EAV) call handler
1220 ! Test other STB bits if desired here
1299 RETURN
1300 ! 5560A STB.EAV (error) handler
1320 PRINT @4, "ERR?" ! Read and clear error
1330 INPUT @4, E%, E$ ! Read in error # and explanation
1340 PRINT "Error# :";E, E$ ! Print error # and explanation
1350 IF (E% <> 0) THEN GOTO 1320! Until no more errors
1360 STOP ! Other commands for your app

## Remote Program Examples

### Verify a Meter in the IEEE-488 Bus

This program selects 10 V dc output, verifies that the Calibrator is set to 10 V, then triggers a Fluke 45
to take a measurement. It shows calibrator output, Fluke 45 reading, and the meter error in ppm. The
program assumes that the Calibrator bus address is 4 and the Fluke 45 bus address is 1.
10 REM THIS PROGRAM VERIFIES THE ACCURACY OF A FLUKE 45 AT 10V DC
20 INIT PORT 0 ! INITIALIZE THE INTERFACE
30 CLEAR PORT 0 ! "
40 PRINT @1, "VDC;RATE 5;AUTO;TRIGGER 2" ! SETS FLUKE 45 TO 10V DC
50 PRINT @4, "OUT 10 V ; OPER; ! SET THE 5560A TO 10V DC
60 PRINT @4, "*WAI; OUT?" ! WAIT FOR SETTLE, REQUEST THE OUTPUT VALUE
70 INPUT @4, V,U$,F,V2,U2$ ! GET THE DATA FROM THE 5560A
80 PRINT @1, "*TRG;VAL?" ! TRIGGER 45 TO TAKE READING
90 INPUT @1, VM ! GET THE DATA FROM THE 45
100 ER = ABS(V - VM)/V * 1E6 ! COMPUTE ERROR
110 PRINT "5560 OUTPUT: ";V;U$ ! PRINT THE RESULTS
120 PRINT "45 MEASURED: ";VM;"V"
130 PRINT "ERROR: ";ER;"PPM"
140 END

### *OPC?, *OPC, and *WAI

The *OPC?, *OPC, and *WAI commands let you maintain control of the order of execution of
commands that could otherwise be passed up by subsequent commands.
If you send an OUT command, you can check if the output has settled by sending the query *OPC?. As
soon as the OUT command has completed (output settled), a 1 appears in the output buffer. Always
follow an *OPC? command with a read command. The read command causes program execution to
pause until the addressed instrument responds. This sample program shows how you can use *OPC?:
10 PRINT @4, "OUT 100V,1KHZ;OPER; *OPC?" ! 5560A ADDRESS IS 4
20 INPUT @4, A ! READ THE "1" FROM THE 5560A
30 !PROGRAM HALTS HERE UNTIL A "1" IS PUT INTO THE OUTPUT BUFFER
40 PRINT "OUTPUT SETTLED"
The *OPC command is similar in operation to the *OPC? query, except that it sets bit 0 (OPC for
Operation Complete) in the Event Status Register to 1 rather than sending a 1 to the output buffer. One
simple use for *OPC is to include it in the program in order for it to generate an SRQ (Service Request).
Then an SRQ handler written into the program can detect the operation complete condition and
respond appropriately. You can use *OPC similarly to *OPC?, except your program must read the ESR
to detect the completion of all operations. This sample program shows how you can use *OPC:
10 REMOTE
20 PRINT @4, "OUT 100V,1KHZ;OPER;*OPC" ! 5560A ADDRESS IS 4
30 PRINT @4, "*ESR?" ! PUT THE ESR BYTE IN BUFFER
40 INPUT @4, A% ! READ THE ESR BYTE
50 IF (A% AND 1%) = 0% GOTO 30 ! TRY AGAIN IF NO OPC
60 PRINT "OUTPUT SETTLED"
70 END
The *WAI command causes the Calibrator to wait until any prior commands are completed before it
continues to the next command, and takes no other action. The *WAI command is a convenient way to
halt operation until the command or commands preceding it are completed. This sample program
shows how you can use *WAI:
10 REMOTE
20 PRINT @4, "OUT 100V,1KHZ;OPER;*WAI" ! 5560A ADDRESS IS 4
30 PRINT @4, "OUT?" ! READ THE OUTPUT VALUE
40 INPUT @4, A$,B$,C$ ! A$ CONTAINS THE OUTPUT VALUE
50 PRINT "OUTPUT SETTLED"
60 PRINT "OUTPUT IS: ";A$;B$;" at ";C$
70 END

230 PRINT @4, "VAL?"
240 REM Read measurement, unit
250 INPUT @4, M,U$
260 GOTO 200

### Input Buffer Operation

As the Calibrator receives each data byte from the controller, it places the bytes in a portion of memory
called the input buffer. The input buffer holds up to 350 data bytes and operates in a first in, first out
fashion.
IEEE-488 The Calibrator treats the EOI IEEE-488 control line as a separate data byte and inserts it into
the input buffer if it is encountered as part of a message terminator. Input buffer operation is
transparent to the program running on the controller. If the controller sends commands faster than the
Calibrator can process them, the input buffer fills to capacity. When the input buffer is full, the
Calibrator holds off the IEEE-488 bus with the NRFD (Not Ready For Data) handshake line. When the
Calibrator has processed a data byte from the full input buffer, it then completes the handshake, which
allows the controller to send another data byte. The Calibrator clears the input buffer on power-up and
on receiving the DCL (Device Clear) or SDC (Selected Device Clear) messages from the controller.
RS-232 Under RS-232-C serial port remote control using ^S (<Cntl> S) XOFF protocol, the Calibrator
issues a ^S XOFF when the input buffer becomes 80 % full. The Calibrator issues a ^Q (<Cntl> Q)
when it has read enough of the input buffer so that it is <40 % full. With RTS (Request to Send)
protocol (selected as part of the RS-232 Port Setup Procedure), the serial interface asserts and
unasserts RTS in response to same conditions as for XON/XOFF protocol.
This section documents the IEEE-488/USBTMC/RS-232/Ethernet remote commands for the
Calibrator. Remote commands duplicate activities that can be initiated from the front panel in local
operation. After the summary table is a complete alphabetical listing of all commands complete with
protocol details. Separate headings in the alphabetical listing provide the parameters and responses,
plus an example for each command. For information on command use, see Remote Operations.
